# **CarND Term 2 Project 4 Writeup** 
# **PID controller** 

#### This repository contains a c++ implementation of a PID controller. The PID controller is able to perform MISSING EXPLANATION,



</br>


The repository is structured so that it works together with the [simulation environment provided by Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases). (The link between the environment and the code is via [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets), and already provided by Udacity). Furthermore, this writeup does *not* include any explanation about PID controllers? MISSING EXPLANATION
